### Notes

There are some differences between Firefox and Chrome in the manifest.json.

Firefox:

-   FF does not support Service Worker and still uses Background Scripts

```json
"background": {
	"scripts": ["./bg.js"]
},
```

-   for a manifest v3 extension an ID is essential for signing.

```json
"browser_specific_settings": {
	"gecko": {
		"id": "UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER"
	}
}
```

Chrome:

-   uses Service Worker in manifest v3

```json
"background": {
	"service_worker": "./service_worker.js",
	"type": "module"
}
```

Git Clone: 
-   rename the manifest-chrome.json or manifest-firefox.json to manifest.json depending on your Browser.
